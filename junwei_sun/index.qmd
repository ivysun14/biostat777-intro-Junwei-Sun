My name is Junwei (Ivy) Sun and I am originally from Shanghai, China. I am a first-year PhD student in the department of Biostatistics at Johns Hopkins University, and my research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and genomics. In my free time, I enjoy horseback riding and have recently started climbing/bouldering!
