    "text": "Survival Analysis Key Concepts\nSurvival analysis refers to statistical methods used to analyze time-to-event data. In other words how long it takes for a specific event (such as death, relapse, or recovery) to occur. Most of the information below are adapted from Sainani (2016).\n\n1. Time\nThe time variable represents how long each subject was followed in the study. It begins at the time of entry (e.g., surgery or diagnosis) and ends at either:\n\nthe time the event happened, or\n\nthe last time the subject was observed (if the event never happened).\n\n\n\n2. Event\nThe event is the outcome of interest (most commonly death). It is normally a binary variable that records whether or not a subject had the event of interest.\n\n\n3. Censoring\nSubjects who have not yet experienced the event by the end of observation are said to be censored. Censoring means we know the subject was event-free for a certain time, but not what happened afterward. This allows researchers to use partial information from everyone in the study.\n\nExample: A patient followed for 5 years without relapse is censored at 5 years — we know they were relapse-free for 5 years, but not beyond potentially due to loss of followup.\n\n\n\n4. Incidence Rate\nThe incidence rate measures how frequently new events occur over time. \\[\\begin{equation*}\n    \\text{Incidence rate} = \\frac{\\text{Number of events}}{\\text{Total person-time at risk}}\n\\end{equation*}\\] It is often expressed per 100 person-years. For example, an incidence rate of 5 deaths per 100 person-years means 5 deaths are expected for every 100 years of follow-up time.\n\n\n5. Survival Curve\nA Kaplan–Meier curve shows the estimated probability of surviving over time. The curve starts at 100% (everyone is event-free initially) and decreases as events occur.\n- The y-axis shows survival probability (from 1 to 0).\n- The x-axis shows time since entry.\n- The curve steps downward as events accumulate.\n\n\n\nA cartoon example of survival curve showing the survival of ten biscuits. This figure is taken from Lockwood (2020)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe steeper the curve, the higher the event rate; if two curves diverge, it suggests a difference in survival between groups."

    "text": "Summary of Results\nIn this analysis of 205 melanoma patients who underwent surgery, we estimated an overall incidence rate of death of about 5.9 deaths per 100 person-years. Patients with ulcerated tumors had a substantially higher incidence rate and worse Kaplan–Meier survival curves than those without ulceration; the incidence rate ratio was about 3.5, and the log-rank test comparing survival curves was highly significant (\\(p=1 \\times 10^{-7}\\)). When inspecting tumor thickness and ulceration together, patients with ulceration and a higher tumor thickness showed significantly worse survival as well. Older age tertiles seem to be associated with worse survival, which is consistent with known prognostic factors in many healthcare problems as older patients tend to be more vulnerable to malignant diseases as well as complications after surgery. Altogether the analysis demonstrated potential risk factors for worse survival after melanoma surgery."

    "text": "Prior to starting my PhD study in Biostatistics at Johns Hopkins, I earned my B.S. in Computational Biology from UCLA and M.S. in Statistics from Stanford University. During this process I developed strong interests in statistical methods for biomedical data, single-cell analysis, and machine learning.\nI enjoy working at the intersection of statistics, computation, and biology, and I am especially excited about problems involving high-dimensional omics data. Recently, I have become particularly interested in the integration of AI/ML with omics data, and I hope to explore the potential of interpretable and robust machine learning methods for biological discovery during my PhD study."
