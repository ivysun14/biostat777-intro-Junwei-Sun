This website was created with Quarto and deployed with Github Pages. The website currently contains 3 separate pages: 
- **Home** - where visitors land when accessing the website
- **About** - more details on self-introduction
- **Example analysis** - a simple R survival data analysis

For publishing, GitHub Pages was used with the following procedures: 
1. The website was first rendered to `docs/` locally using `quarto render`
2. A `.nojekyll` file was added to the root of `docs/` so that GitHub Pages was told to not do additional processing of the published site using Jekyll
3. The `docs/` directory was then committed and pushed to the repository
4. Configured 'settings' in the GitHub repository so it knows to publish from the docs directory of the main branch
